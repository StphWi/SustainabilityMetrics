See comments field.,"It has been assumed that the food processing industry is located in Spain. Sherry is fortified wine, where wine is added little amounts of distilled spirit from grapes, raising the alcohol content. We do not have data for the pure distilled spirit around 95% alcohol, so we model sherry as a mixture of wine plus brandy, which is distilled wine. We have calculated the mixture (73% wine, 27% brandy) so that the final product has the right alcohol content of 15.9% alcohol by weight according to the FRIDA database (DTU 2019). Since brandy has 32% kg alcohol/kg instead of 95%, the necessary mass of brandy in the sherry mixture is higher than if the actual spirit was modelled.

.","It has been assumed that the food processing industry is located in Denmark. Ingredients refer to a slightly different smoothie than the one suggested by CONCITO, taken from Nemlig (2020a). The list of ingredients declares the number of fruit pieces used to produce 0.15 L of smoothie. This has been roughly converted to mass by average weight of fruit pieces, e.g. an apple is 85 g. Based on the input of fruit and the output of smoothie we establish an amount of organic waste. All inputs for manufacturing have been assumed as in orange juice from Jungbluth (2013).
